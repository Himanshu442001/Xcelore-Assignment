**Project Overview**
<br>

This project is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It provides functionalities for user management, authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), CRUD operations on users, pagination, search functionality, error handling, and a responsive user interface using Material-UI.

Features

**User Authentication**
User registration with role assignment (admin, user).
Secure login/logout using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.

**User Management**

CRUD operations for managing users (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
<br>

Admins have access to all user management functionalities.

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
Different roles (admin, user) have distinct permissions.
<br>

RBAC ensures appropriate access levels across the application.

**Pagination and Search**
